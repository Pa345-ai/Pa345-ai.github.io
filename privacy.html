        </div>

        <h2>1. Merchant of Record & Financial Governance</h2>
        <p>Our global order processing is managed by <strong>Paddle.com Market Ltd</strong>. As our <strong>Merchant of Record</strong>, Paddle is the legal entity responsible for the transaction. <strong>Ranasinghe Infrastructure System</strong> never comes into contact with, stores, or processes your full credit card number, CVV, or banking credentials.</p>
        <p>Paddle is fully <strong>PCI-DSS Level 1 Compliant</strong> and adheres to the <strong>SOC2 security framework</strong>, ensuring your $10,000+ transactions are shielded by banking-grade encryption.</p>

        <h2>2. Detailed Data Classification</h2>
        <h3>A. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
        <p>We collect only what is strictly necessary to grant license access: <strong>Full Legal Name, Corporate Email Address, and Billing Address.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>B. Transactional Artifacts</h3>
        <p>For the <strong>$10,000 Full IP Buyout</strong>, we record the timestamp, transaction ID, and the specific version of the Infrastructure Kit delivered. This is required for legal proof of ownership transfer.</p>

        <h3>C. Attribution Data</h3>
        <p>We use unique <strong>Broker Attribution IDs</strong> via our affiliate system (Endorsely). This records the referral source but does not link your identity to any third-party marketing databases.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Retention & Destruction Policy</h2>
        <p>We do not hold your data indefinitely. Our retention schedule is as follows:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Marketing Data:</strong> Deleted after 12 months of inactivity.</li>
            <li><strong>License Records:</strong> Retained for the duration of your active license to provide security patches.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Records:</strong> Retained for 7 years as required by international tax law (Managed by Paddle).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Your Rights (GDPR / CCPA / APPI)</h2>
        <p>Regardless of your location, we extend the following rights to all customers:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You may request the "Right to be Forgotten" once your license expires.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Portability:</strong> You may request a copy of all data we hold on your organization in a machine-readable format.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You may opt-out of all non-essential communications at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Information Security Measures</h2>
        <p>Access to customer license data is restricted to "Need-to-Know" personnel. All internal access requires <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong> and is logged for auditing purposes. In the event of a data breach, all affected parties will be notified within <strong>72 hours</strong>.</p>
